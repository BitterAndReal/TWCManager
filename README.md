# TWCManager
TWCManager lets you control the amount of power delivered by a Tesla Wall Connector (TWC) to the car it's charging.  This can save around 6kWh per month when used to track a local green energy source like solar panels on your roof.  It can also avoid drawing grid energy for those without net metering or limit charging to times of day when prices are cheapest.

Due to hardware limitations, TWCManager will not work with Tesla's older High Power Wall Connectors (HPWCs) that were discontinued around April 2016.

See **TWCManager Installation.pdf** for how to install and use.

download the forked code to your raspberry pi using this git command:
git clone -b master --single-branch https://github.com/BitterAndReal/TWCManager.git~/TWC
